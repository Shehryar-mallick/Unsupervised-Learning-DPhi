This was the final hands on exercise to be performed to employ the clustering algorithms and PCA.

Following were the three major tasks:

1) Data Loading and EDA
2) Clustering
  > used Elbow and silhouette scores to determine the optimal number of clusters
  > Performed Kmeans clustering
  > Model Evaluation using rand_score and adjusted rand_score
  
3) Principal Component Analysis
  > finding 2 PCA
  > finding 4 PCA

Libraries Used:
> Data manipulation:
  pandas

> Data Visualization:
  seaborn
  matplotlib
  yellowbrick
  missingno

> Model Creation, Evaluation, Feature Scaling, Preprocessing:
  sklearn
